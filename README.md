# MGC and Recommendation Model

A machine learning project focused on building and evaluating a recommendation model. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks, including `p2.ipynb`, demonstrating data processing, modeling, and evaluation for a recommendation system task.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

`p2.ipynb` includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Building for Recommendation
- Results and Evaluation of Appropriate Algorithms

> 📌 Purpose: To implement and understand the mechanics of a recommendation system — learning how user-item interactions can be modeled to provide personalized suggestions.

---

## 📌 Motivation

Recommendation systems are widely used in applications like online retail, streaming platforms, and personalized content delivery. They help in delivering relevant suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.

This project aims to:
- Demonstrate traditional recommendation techniques
- Compare models and understand evaluation metrics
- Serve as an educational exploration in building recommender systems

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Loads and processes the dataset
- Computes interaction matrices and similarity measures
- Trains recommendation model(s)
- Evaluates performance with standard metrics
- Outputs sample recommendations
